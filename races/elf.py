        text = "Elves are among the longest-lived races in fantasy worlds, often reaching a thousand years of age. Their unique relationship with time shapes their personality, values, and how other races perceive them. Physically, they are slender, slightly shorter than humans, with long, well-kept hair in many colors, almond-shaped eyes, and their most distinctive featureâ€”long, pointed ears. They devote their lives to what they value most, such as dance, music, swordplay, archery, and arcane magic. To outsiders, they may seem distant, cold, or even arrogant, especially when away from their homelands. However, once an elf forms a friendship, it is deep and enduring, often lasting beyond the lifetimes of many other beings."

They appreciate well-crafted, lasting things, reflecting their own longevity. Their perception of time makes them patient, meticulous, and focused on perfection. This mindset influences all aspects of their culture and personal behavior."
