This repository contains the development of a semester project in **Python (Flask)**. The goal is to create a **Character Creator** based on the **RPG Old Dragon**.

The project is for the **Special Topics in Software** course in my **4th semester** of the <a href="https://cursos.up.edu.br/grad-ciencia-da-computacao-up/p" target="_blank">Computer Science program at Universidade Positivo</a>. Course taught by Aryel Marlus Repula de Oliveira.

The application offers a **simple and intuitive web tool** for quick **character creation** following the Old Dragon rules. <br>
The user accesses the homepage and **chooses one of three attribute distribution**. After the attributes are rolled and distributed, the player **selects their race and class**. Finally, the user **gives their character a name** and it is created. A **button allows the character to be exported and saved as a structured JSON file**, making it easy to store or import later. <br>
The project demonstrates the **practical application** of Flask routes, Jinja2 templates, session control, data modeling and JSON manipulation.

Thanks!
